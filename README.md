## Summary
I got an MBA in Finance in 2019 and am currently working as an auditor for a Pharmaceutical company in Washington DC. Right after graduation, I was so passionate to learn how to code. It is awesome to be able to build things from scratch that could benefit people's life. This is how I start my journey as a programmer.

This is my first completed web app project. Making a start is often the most difficult part of a journey but I made it!
